  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Graduate student in Public Informatics at Rutgers University with extensive experience analyzing large-scale digital datasets, including social media and public data sources. My LLM-based chatbot projects on postpartum depression and international student stress, accepted at ICITS and JBDAI, showcase my AI-driven, privacy-conscious research expertise. I also conducted an exploratory study on social media’s impact on mental well-being using R and data visualization tools. Proficient in Python, R, and GIS, I bring a data-driven, ethical approach to research at the intersection of AI, mental health, and digital privacy, well aligned with the objectives of the NSF-funded project on encrypted social networks. I am deeply committed to this field and plan to pursue doctoral study focused on privacy-preserving technologies and human-centered computing. </p>
